A local animal shelter is planning for a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder 
which is able to dispense food for cats and dogs at scheduled times, monitor whether 
food has been consumed or the amount of food that has been consumed, alert staff if
thereâ€™s an issue. The objective is to design a low-cost, programmable pet feeder for a 
local animal shelter. It must work for both cats and dogs, considering different feeding behaviors. 
Constraints include limited budget, technical simplicity, and ethical responsibility to ensure animal welfare.
