Step 2: Organise and Describe the Data
Features: Scheduled Feeding (e.g. 6am, 11am, 3pm etc.), Food Consumption Monitoring, Alert for an issue.
Input: Real-time clock, Food level sensor, Weight sensor under bowl, Feed Quantity, Pet type
Output: Servo motor, Alert system, Feeding log
Assumptions: Sensors are reliable, Animals eat individually, feeding times are fixed
Expected Outcome: Food is dispensed on time, consumption is tracked, staff alerted if issues occur.
