Step 5: Test and Refine the Solution (Debug and Verify)
	Manual Testing: 
	Test servo motor by triggering rotation and observing movement. 
	Place weights on load cell to verify accurate sensor readings and stability.

Scenario-Based Testing:
	Schedule feeding time and confirm food is dispensed correctly.
	Monitor bowl to detect pet consumption. If food remains uneaten, system should trigger an alert. 
	Check response to pet blocking access and ensure alert logic activates.
	Validate logging of events and sensor data for traceability and performance review.

	Some suggested improvements
1.	Adaptive Feeding Schedule
2.	Smart Alert System
3.	Sensor Health Check
4.	Mobile App Integration
